hoarderMediaOS
==============

This readme previously contained a tutorial. It is now found
[at TUTORIAL.md](https://github.com/cmotc/hoarderMediaOS/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md)
While it's content is largely still relevant, the version of this project it
refers to has now changed. Look into the includes/*.mk files for more examples.

This wholly unnecessary and abusive concoction of Docker containers, Makefiles,
and so-called "auto" scripts is the latest and most successful of my attempts to
create my own custom Debian-based Live Media. At this point I basically have to
acknowledge, it's been pretty much entirely for the hell of it. But it's been
educational too. I suppose that was a little by accident, thus the tone of the
tutorial linked above.

I suppose that if there is a point, it's that, I strongly believe that the
benefits of being able to operate every single function of every single device
that a person owns with serviceable, reproducible parts decidedly outweights
the costs in basically every scenario. In some cases, like auto repair, this
is widely accepted. But in other cases very consequential cases, it's not even
acknowledged.
